# PlaySnake
It is a humble snake running through your windows console. If you would like to see improvements, feel free to open issue!

# Day 3.
I realized that it's really hard to understand how the cursor should be navigated each second rather than blindly trying to design your code base.
I mean, before I start this journey, I used to believe that I will learn something new every day. I haven't been lied.. 

The thing I learnt today is that when you write any program - it really doesn't matter what type of code piece you are writing - try to first focus on what is the problem. Understand the problem well. Otherwise like me, it's already day X, I didn't achieve writing simple snake game. Though it can seem easy at first glance, especially if you don't write any program (or logic) by yourself for long time, it will be harder for you as well. No doubt. Again the thing that I learnt today is - first understand your problem that you are trying to solve. 

After several days of waste of time, today I understood it. The thing I need to solve is simple figuring out how you should move the console cursor to make it draw correct form of snake in each clock tick.
So no code design initially. No yapping. No waste of time. Just focus on problem. Then you will easily, gradually be able to refactor it on the way. Ofc, if you want.. That's it

# Day 4.
Finally!

I'm writing readme file midnight.. :) Today I made a decision to start doing a little brainstorming.. I thought I need to think on it by fresh brain, because it has been a few weeks I have not been doing snake game. 
So guess what? I think, I finalized the gameplay. I mean, my snake can run at the moment. I can direct it anywhere I want (left, right, top, bottom). 
Feels like I invented new rocket technology towards cosmos, anyway..

I'll commit it. You'll see. I did it without any help from internet. It made me feel fresh. So I'll probably focus more on remaining features in the upcoming days.

So Enjoy my snake! :D
